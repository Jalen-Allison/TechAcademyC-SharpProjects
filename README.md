# C# Projects

Here are some projects I made using C#, .NET Framework, MVC, ADO.NET, Entity Framework, LINQ, SQL and more using the IDE Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.


### Main Projects:

  * Newsletter Application
  
  * TwentyOne (BlackJack) Game
  
  * Car Insurance Application
  
Newsletter App
* This project is a datbase-first Entity Framework MVC application that mimics an online sign-up for a newsletter. This application included an admin page that gave the administrator the ability to view all current subscribers as well as option to unsubscribe a user of their choosing.

TwentyOne Game
* This project is a console application that utilized the .NET Framework. This application functioned as a blackjack game within the console, complete with users, a dealer with full functionality, a randomized (shuffled) card deck for each instance (hand) of the game, and exception handling for a player attempting to cheat the game.

Car Insurance App
* This project is a database-first ASP.NET MVC web application that utilizes .NET Framework, Bootstrap, and Razor syntax. The app mimics a car insurance wewbsite and allows the user to input their information including age, car year/make/model to be insured, number of speeding tickets and DUIs, and would perform business logic to calculate an insurance estimate. All this information was then stored on a SQL Server database. This app also featured an admin page where the administrator could view all insurees who have applied.
